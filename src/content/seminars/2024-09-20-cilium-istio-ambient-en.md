## Key Topics

### Introduction to Cilium
- eBPF-based networking
- Network policies and visibility
- Monitoring with Hubble

### Istio Ambient Mesh
- Sidecar-less service mesh
- ztunnel and waypoint proxy
- Advantages over traditional Istio

### Integration Strategy
- Cilium + Istio Ambient architecture
- Network policy layering
- Performance benchmark results

## Target Audience

- DevOps engineers interested in Kubernetes networking
- Teams considering service mesh adoption
- Developers interested in eBPF technology
