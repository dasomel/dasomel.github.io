Hello! I've migrated my existing Jekyll-based blog to Astro.

## Why Astro?

- **Fast Build Speed**: Much faster builds compared to Jekyll
- **Modern Development Experience**: TypeScript and ESM support
- **Island Architecture**: Load JavaScript only where needed
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Easy styling

## Major Changes

1. Jekyll → Astro migration
2. Minimal Mistakes theme → Custom Tailwind design
3. Liquid templates → Astro components
4. Type-safe content management with Content Collections

I plan to continue writing technical posts about Cloud, Kubernetes, and DevOps.

Thank you!
